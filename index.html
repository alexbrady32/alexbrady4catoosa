            <h2>Why I'm Running</h2>
            <p>
                I’m running for County Commissioner because I believe our government should work for all of us—not just for a select few. We need leaders who understand the challenges faced by ordinary people and who are committed to building a community where everyone has the chance to thrive. 
				I believe in the democratic process, and I want to ensure that every citizen in our county has a choice when as they go to vote.

            <h2>My Vision for Catoosa County</h2>
            <p>
                It’s time for open and transparent government, where decisions are made with input from everyone. We need affordable housing solutions, improved infrastructure, and leadership that listens. I will be a good steward of taxpayer money, ensuring that spending is done in an equitable manner. And I will work with people from all backgrounds to find solutions that move our county forward together.
			<p>
			</p>
				I’m not running to make promises I can’t keep—what I offer is my character of integrity. Together, we can create a Catoosa County that works for all of us.
